<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
<b>Caveink</b> is a set of Inkscape extensions for drawing cave maps.
</p>
<p>
It is developed from my similar, previous project that is already well
tested and has been used to produce many beautiful drawings. However, itself
it is still somewhat a <b>work in progress</b> that needs more extensive
testing. Any help in that is appreciated. 
</p>

<p>
<u>DISCLAIMER</u>: All the extensions are provided as-is. Play and evaluate them
well before using for your serious project. All this stuff may not work for you,
make your Inkscape crash or make it run painfully slow. Definitely <b>do not</b>
use the methods described here for big cave maps. If your cave is dozens
kilometers long and you want it in 1:500 or 1:1000, consider Therion or some
other, faster software.
</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>
<p>
If you are using <i>Microsoft Windows</i>, it is easiest to use the
self-extracting installer: <a
href="download/Inkscape-0.91-1.exe">Inkscape-0.91-1.exe</a>. It installs
both Inkscape 0.91 <b>and</b> the extensions. Before running it, remove any
former Inkscape versions from your system. <i>Note that although there is a
never version of Inkscape available, 0.92, I recommend against using it.
This is because it tends to crash much often. Hopefully the new bugs will
be fixed in 0.93.</i>
</p>

<p>
As an alternative, you can download just the extensions as a zip file: <a
href="download/caveink-1.0beta3.zip">caveink-1.0beta3.zip</a>. Copy files
from the <i>symbols</i>, <i>patterns</i>, <i>keys</i> and <i>extensions</i>
subdirectories into the relevant directories in your Inkscape installation
directory (could be <i>/usr/share/inkscape</i> or <i>C:\Program
Files\Inkscape</i> or something similar). You also have to install the
<i>SpeleoUIS3</i> font on your system (from <i>fonts</i> subdirectory in the
archive) in order for the line styles to work.
